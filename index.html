    <h2>About Fullstack Web Development</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The term ‘full stack’ represents the ability to work on both – front-end and back-end parts of the application. Full stack development refers to the development of cutting-edge, modern, end-to-end applications including frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) development A full stack developer is a person who possesses skills to develop complete web apps including front-end and back-end parts. Full stack itself represents a ‘complete’ stack that includes everything you require to build modern-day applications.
     A full stack developer must have proficiency in one or more frontend frameworks and one or more backend languages.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it existed since the evolution of software development, especially web development. In the early 80s and 90s, many programmers single-handedly coded entire applications without requiring different skilled professionals, technologies, and programming languages. This was about the time when hardware and memory devices were limited and not so advanced.With the introduction of client-server programming and the advent of innovative technologies in the 1990s-2000, software development started becoming more layered with the server part, database, presentation, and business logic.
    The full stack term was coined after the 2000s(the exact year is not known) when web development required different expertise within layered structures of the development. In addition to this, different client-side and server-side frameworks entered the development market, requiring separate professionals to work on frontend and backend.
    At present, full stack developers are dominating the web development market and enjoying top positions. Full stack development skills are one of the most demanded skills for the upcoming years.</p><br><br><br>
